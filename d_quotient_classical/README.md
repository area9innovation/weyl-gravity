# Classical $D$-quotient challenge

This directory is the fail-closed handoff for the classical question posed in
[`notes/d-quotient-classical-team-brief.md`](../notes/d-quotient-classical-team-brief.md):
when is cylinder time translation/dilatation $D$ proper gauge, and when is it
a charged physical symmetry?

The status record deliberately separates three kinds of statement:

1. a charge verdict on a precisely declared phase space;
2. an imported theorem about the selected absolute residual complex;
3. an open comparison in a different matter, background, or boundary setting.

In particular, the Paper-VII Cartan contraction is not accepted as a proof
that $D$ has zero covariant phase-space charge.  Conversely, a nonzero
quadratic charge on the unrestricted linearized space is not accepted as a
counterexample on the Taub-zero, nonlinearly integrable phase space.

## Artifacts

- Machine-readable status:
  [`certificates/CLASSICAL_D_QUOTIENT_STATUS.json`](certificates/CLASSICAL_D_QUOTIENT_STATUS.json)
- JSON Schema:
  [`schema/classical-status-v1.schema.json`](schema/classical-status-v1.schema.json)
- Human report:
  [`reports/classical-d-quotient-status.md`](reports/classical-d-quotient-status.md)
- Dependency-free verifier:
  [`verify_classical_status.py`](verify_classical_status.py)

The only scientific verdicts are:

```text
D_GAUGE
D_CHARGED
SECTOR_DEPENDENT
NOT_HAMILTONIAN
```

An untested setting does not receive a fifth pseudo-verdict.  It has
`assessment_status = NOT_TESTED` or `OPEN` and `verdict = null`.

## Verification

From `physics/symplectic-reconstruction/` run:

```bash
python3 d_quotient_classical/verify_classical_status.py --guards
python3 symbolic/verify_compact_cylinder_d_charge_audit.py --check
python3 -m unittest bridge.taub_moment_map.tests.test_compact_d_charge
python3 symbolic/verify_conformal_d_global_alternatives.py --check-result
```

The first command checks evidence hashes, dependency tags, exact setting and
complex inventories, verdict prerequisites, and six mutation guards.  It
does not rerun the mathematical producers.  The next three commands are the
scoped producer checks for the compact charge and alternative residual
complexes.

## Promotion rule

A setting may move to `CERTIFIED` only when its field space, allowed
variations, boundary/corner conditions, charge variation, integrability,
flux, conservation, and reference normalization are recorded.  A
`LORENTZIAN_BOUNDARY` or `COVARIANT_SMOOTH` verdict additionally requires the
`LORENTZIAN-CAUSAL` dependency tag.  Reduced-mode evidence remains explicitly
reduced-mode evidence.
