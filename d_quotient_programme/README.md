# Cross-programme \(D\)-quotient validation dossier

This directory consolidates the four investigations of whether cylinder time
translation/dilatation may be quotiented as gauge.  It is a validation dossier,
not yet Paper IX.

The dossier never assigns one universal Boolean to \(D\).  Every claim is
keyed by

```text
(generator, phase space, boundary conditions, lifecycle layer)
```

because the existing results concern different objects:

- the classical compact-cylinder charge and Taub-zero reduction;
- the real asymptotic generator dictionary and boundary-preservation gate;
- nonlinear homological transfer and interacting Cartan stability;
- the renormalized quantum Ward/QME obstruction.

## Verification

From `physics/symplectic-reconstruction/`:

```bash
python3 d_quotient_programme/verify_programme_status.py --check --guards
```

The verifier checks the exact Git commit and SHA-256 digest of every imported
team certificate.  A team updates its own certificate first; the programme
certificate is regenerated only after the new claim has passed its team-level
verification.

## Publication policy

Papers VII--VIII retain their completed theorem, now with an explicit compact
phase-space split.  Paper IX is reserved for a classical scope theorem after
the scalar-clock gate and at least one boundary or interaction theorem land.
A possible Paper X is reserved for interaction and quantum stability after the
applicable classical export and QME gates pass.
