# Euclidean spectral coefficient gate

Dependency tag for every future result in this directory:
`EUCLIDEAN-SPECTRAL`.

No Euclidean coefficient has been computed by the Branch C bootstrap. The
schema in this directory is a promotion gate: a coefficient record is valid
only when it supplies an exact coefficient together with the action
normalization, signature, gauge, regularization, zero-mode policy, contour
policy, frozen classical commit, and proof certificate.

The schema fixes all Lorentzian causal, QME, and anomaly-cancellation claims
to `false`. A Euclidean local-effective-action coefficient cannot promote
any of those claims by itself.

Before emitting a record, the Euclidean package must separately certify:

- ellipticity of the complete gauge-fixed complex;
- exact field, ghost, and auxiliary multiplicities;
- conformal-Killing and all other zero-mode removals;
- the determinant measure and indefinite-direction contour;
- equivalence of auxiliary and fourth-order formulations;
- normalization relative to `S_W = alpha_C integral sqrt(g) C^2`;
- Euler and Pontryagin conventions.
